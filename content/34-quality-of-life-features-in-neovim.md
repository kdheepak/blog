summary: Three features in neovim that can make you more productive
---

I want to share three features in `neovim` quality of life improvements over `vim`, that are built in to the editor.

# Live Substition

By default, `vim`â€™s `:substitute` command only modifies the document when you execute the command by pressing `Enter` (`<CR>`).
In `neovim`, you can change the document live as well as show a preview of all the changes you are going to make by setting the following option.

```
:set inccommand=nosplit
```

# Highlight Yanked Text

The next is the ability to highlight yanked text^[If you want to use this feature in `neovim` v0.4.x or in `vim` 8, you can do so with this plugin: <https://github.com/machakann/vim-highlightedyank>.].

At the time of writing, you'll need a nightly release for this feature of `neovim`.

```bash
$ nvim --version | head -1
```

```
NVIM v0.5.0-556-ge78658348
```

You can add the following in your vimrc to enable this feature:

<figure class="fullwidth">
```vim
augroup LuaHighlight
  autocmd!
  autocmd TextYankPost * silent! lua require'vim.highlight'.on_yank()
augroup END
```
</figure>

# Built in LSP

`neovim` has a built in implementation of Language Server Protocol client and [default configurations for over 50 languages](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp).

At the time of writing, you'll need a nightly release for this feature of `neovim`.

```bash
$ nvim --version | head -1
```

```
NVIM v0.5.0-556-ge78658348
```

Setting it up requires three steps.

1) Adding the configurations repository as a `neovim` plugin:

```
Plug 'neovim/nvim-lsp'
```

2) Running `:LspInstall {servername}`:

```vim
:LspInstall sumneko_lua
:LspInstall julials
:LspInstall nimls
:LspInstall rust_analyzer
:LspInstall vimls
:LspInstall pyls
```

This will install the language server protocol for `lua`, `julia`, `nim`, `rust`, `vim` and `python`.

3) Setting up the configurations with all the options you want in your vimrc:

<figure class="fullwidth">
```
lua <<EOF
    local nvim_lsp = require'nvim_lsp'
    nvim_lsp.sumneko_lua.setup()
    nvim_lsp.julials.setup()
    nvim_lsp.nimls.setup()
    nvim_lsp.vimls.setup()
    nvim_lsp.pyls.setup{
        settings = {
            pyls = {
                configurationSources = {
                    pycodestyle,
                    flake8
                }
            }
        }
    }
EOF
```
</figure>
